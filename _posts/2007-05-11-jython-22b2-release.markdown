title: Jython 2.2b2 released!
---

In news from the all-consuming destroyer of free time front, I've just released the second beta
towards Jython 2.2. [Download
it](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12867&package_id=12218&release_id=507592)
and [tell us if anything is broken](http://jython.org/bugs)!

The changes aren't actually that dramatic as the first beta was almost feature complete for 2.2 and the beta users didn't uncover many bugs. We did manage to fix 30 bugs, complete the new-style class integration and add a cool new customizable object adaptation system.

There are only a couple small changes to make a release candidate, so it should appear in a couple weeks. As long as all goes well there we can make the release a week or so after that and have the first stable release of Jython in over five years. It's a testament to the power of the idea of Python on the JVM that a project as dormant as Jython is awakening from its slumber.
